Task 1:
1.1 Retrieve customer names and phone numbers
o Each customer has an assigned salesperson. You must write a query to create a call sheet that lists:
▪ The salesperson
▪ A column named CustomerName that displays how the customer contact should be greeted (for example, Mr Smith)
▪ The customer’s phone number.

SELECT 
      SalesPerson
    , CONCAT(Title,' ',LastName) AS CustomerName
    , Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customers
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.2 Retrieve the heaviest products information: Transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products. Retrieve the names, weight of the top ten percent of products by weight. Then, add new column named Number of sell days (caculated from SellStartDate and SellEndDate) of these products (if sell end date isn't defined then get Today date)

SELECT TOP 10 PERCENT
      Weight
    , Name
    , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    , CASE 
          WHEN SellEndDate IS NULL THEN DATEDIFF('day',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,SellStartDate) ELSE DATEDIFF('day',SellEndDate,SellStartDate) 
      END AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 1-- 
    , IIF(SellEndDate IS NULL, DATEDIFF('day',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,SellStartDate), DATEDIFF('day',SellEndDate,SellStartDate) AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 2-- 
    , DATEDIFF('day',SellStartDate,ISNULL(SellEndDate,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 3-- 
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY Weight DESC

Task 2: Retrieve customer order data
2.1 As you continue to work with the Adventure Works customer data, you must create queries for reports that have been requested by the sales team.
Retrieve a list of customer companies
o You have been asked to provide a list of all customer companies in the
format Customer ID : Company Name - for example, 78: Preferred Bikes

SELECT *
      CONCAT(CustomerID,': ', CompanyName) AS CustomerCompany
FROM SalesLT.Customers
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.2 Retrieve a list of sales order revisions
o The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve data for a report that shows:
▪ The sales order number and revision number in the format () – for example SO71774 (2).
▪ The order date converted to ANSI standard 102 format (yyyy.mm.dd – for example 2015.01.31).

SELECT
      CONCAT(SalesOrderNumber,' ','(',RevisionNumber,')') AS FormartedNumber
    , DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate,%Y-%m-%d) AS FormatedDate
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
===============================================================================================================================
Task 3: Retrieve customer contact details (hard)
3.1 Some records in the database include missing or unknown values that are returned as NULL. You must create some queries that handle these NULL values appropriately.
Retrieve customer contact names with middle names if known
o You have been asked to write a query that returns a list of customer names. The list must consist of a single column in the format first last (for example Keith Harris) if the middle name is unknown, or first middle last (for example Jane M. Gates) if a middle name is known.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3.2 Retrieve primary contact details
o Customers may provide Adventure Works with an email address, a phone number, or both. If an email address is available, then it should be used as the primary contact method; if not, then the phone number should be used. You must write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if
known, and otherwise the phone number.

3.3 As you continue to work with the Adventure Works customer, product and sales data, you must create queries for reports that have been requested by the sales team.
Retrieve a list of customers with no address
o A sales employee has noticed that Adventure Works does not have address information for all customers. You must write a query that returns a list of customer IDs, company names, contact names (first name and last name), and phone numbers for customers with no address stored in the database.
