Task 1:
1.1 Retrieve customer names and phone numbers
o Each customer has an assigned salesperson. You must write a query to create a call sheet that lists:
▪ The salesperson
▪ A column named CustomerName that displays how the customer contact should be greeted (for example, Mr Smith)
▪ The customer’s phone number.

SELECT 
      SalesPerson
    , CONCAT(Title,' ',LastName) AS CustomerName
    , Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customers

1.2 Retrieve the heaviest products information: Transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products. Retrieve the names, weight of the top ten percent of products by weight. Then, add new column named Number of sell days (caculated from SellStartDate and SellEndDate) of these products (if sell end date isn't defined then get Today date)

SELECT TOP 10 PERCENT
      Weight
    , Name
    , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    , CASE 
          WHEN SellEndDate IS NULL THEN DATEDIFF('day',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,SellStartDate) ELSE DATEDIFF('day',SellEndDate,SellStartDate) 
      END AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 1-- 
    , IIF(SellEndDate IS NULL, DATEDIFF('day',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,SellStartDate), DATEDIFF('day',SellEndDate,SellStartDate) AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 2-- 
    , DATEDIFF('day',SellStartDate,ISNULL(SellEndDate,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS NumberOfSellDays --Option 3-- 
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY Weight DESC
