Task 1: Generate invoice reports
Adventure Works Cycles sells directly to retailers, who must be invoiced for their orders. You have been tasked with writing a query to generate a list of invoices to be sent to customers.
1.1 Retrieve customer orders
o As an initial step towards generating the invoice report, write a query that returns the company name from the SalesLT.Customer table, and the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table.

SELECT CompanyName
     , SaleOrderID
     , TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeaderCustomer 
INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader 
ON SalesOrderHeader.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID

1.2 Retrieve customer orders with addresses
Extend your customer orders query to include the Main Office address for each customer, including the full street address, city, state or province, postal code, and country or region
Tip: Note that each customer can have multiple addressees in the SalesLT.Address table, so the database developer has created the SalesLT.CustomerAddress table to enable a many-to-many relationship between customers and addresses. Your query will need to include both of these tables, and should filter the results so that only Main Office addresses are included.

SELECT DISTINCT
      City
    , StateProvince
    , PostalCode
    , CountryRegion
FROM
