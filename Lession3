Task 1: Generate invoice reports
Adventure Works Cycles sells directly to retailers, who must be invoiced for their orders. You have been tasked with writing a query to generate a list of invoices to be sent to customers.
1.1 Retrieve customer orders
o As an initial step towards generating the invoice report, write a query that returns the company name from the SalesLT.Customer table, and the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table.

SELECT CompanyName
     , SaleOrderID
     , TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeaderCustomer 
INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader 
ON SalesOrderHeader.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.2 Retrieve customer orders with addresses
Extend your customer orders query to include the Main Office address for each customer, including the full street address, city, state or province, postal code, and country or region
Tip: Note that each customer can have multiple addressees in the SalesLT.Address table, so the database developer has created the SalesLT.CustomerAddress table to enable a many-to-many relationship between customers and addresses. Your query will need to include both of these tables, and should filter the results so that only Main Office addresses are included.

SELECT 
    cus.CustomerID
    , City
    , StateProvince 
    , CountryRegion
    , PostalCode
FROM SalesLT.Customer  AS cus 
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS cus_address
    ON cus.CustomerID = cus_address.CustomerID -- Lấy KH có địa chỉ -- 
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Address AS adress 
    ON cus_address.AddressID = adress.AddressID -- lấy địa chỉ của KH có địa chỉ --
INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS header 
    ON cus.CustomerID = header.CustomerID -- Lấy
WHERE AddressType = 'Main Office'

Task 2: Retrieve customer data
As you continue to work with the Adventure Works customer, product and sales data, you must create queries for reports that have been requested by the sales team.
  
Retrieve a list of products
○ A sales manager needs a list of ordered product with more information.
You must write a query that returns a list of product name (is generated by the string preceded by the ''-'' character (example: HL Road Frame)), only started selling in 2006, Product model name contains ''Road'', CategoryName contains
''Bikes'' and ListPrice value with integer part equal to 2443
